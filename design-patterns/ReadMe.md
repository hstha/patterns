# Design Pattern

A design pattern is a conceptual solution blueprint for common problems in software design that can be customized to solve a particular design problem.

It is not an algorithm, a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, but a high-level description of a solution for a particular problem.

An algorithm has a clear set of actions to achieve a goal but a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see the result and features, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

## Why should we learn patterns?

To work as a programmer you need not know about design patterns. But learning these patterns is useful for to following reasons:

- The patterns are like a toolkit of tried and tested solutions for the common occurring problems in software design. Knowing these patterns is useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.

- They define a common language programmers can use to communicate more efficiently. You can just tell the name of the pattern for a specific problem without needing to explain what the pattern is, how to implement it and how it can be used to solve that problem.

> It is said that never use design patterns until and unless it is necessary. It adds complexity to the code whereas simpler code would do just fine.

## Knowing the right design patterns have the following advantages

- **Code Quality**: Helps to write clean, maintainable and reusable code.
- **Scalability**: Make applications more scalable and capable of handling future demands.
- **Flexibility**: Enable easier modifications and enhancements to your codebase.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Improve modularity and reduce tight coupling between components.
- **Code Consistency**: Standard solutions lead to more consistent and readable code.

## Classification of design patterns

Based on the intent or purpose the design patterns are categorized into three types by Gang of Four (GOF):

- **Creational patterns**: It provides object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns**: It explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns**: It takes care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## When to use/apply design patterns?

Don't apply if upfront as it adds complexity to code. Only apply the design pattern when the specific problem arises, instead try fixing the problem using simpler code instead.
